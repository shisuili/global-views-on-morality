# global-views-on-morality
this is a data visualization using d3js

data collected from http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/04/15/global-morality/ as PDF file.
In order to use data in this visulization we need to transfer it to program readable format, in this case, CSV files. I found a tool wrote with Python called PDFMiner which is for extracting information from PDF docments to texts. (https://github.com/euske/pdfminer)
